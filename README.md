Utility to calculate percentage energy used during Ovo Energy's powermove hours 


A simple utility to calculate percetage of energy used during certain hours via a CSV file. I use this to calculate my "PowerMove" percentage from OvoEnergy. The process to get a CSV for Ovo can be achieved through Hildebrande Bright.
Simple download the Bright app on Android or IOS and follow the setup instructions, then head on over to glowmarkt.com, log in and download a csv file with 30 minute increments. 
launch the python file and a GUI will pop up requesting you to navigate to the CSV file and input a start and end time (Defaults to powermove hours 16:00:00 and 19:00:00)
